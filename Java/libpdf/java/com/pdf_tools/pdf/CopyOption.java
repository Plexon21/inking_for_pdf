     * Logical structure elements can be "tagged" with descriptions or
     * alternative text. E.g. "tagging" allows the contents of an image to be
     * described to the visually impaired.

     * It is recommended to use this option, if all input documents are
     * "tagged". Otherwise this could be deactivated in order to create smaller
     * output files and get a much better performance. This option is required
     * for PDF/A level A conformance (e.g. PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-2a, PDF/A-3a).

     * that includes a hash value based on the content of the document that is
     * being signed. If the document is modified at a later time, the computed
     * hash value is no longer correct and the signature becomes invalid, i.e.
     * the validation will fail and will report that the document has been
     * modified since the signature has been applied. Second, an optional visual
     * appearance on a page of the PDF document. The signature appearance can be
     * useful to indicate the presence of a digital signature by a particular
     * signer.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Processing the PDF with 3-Heightsâ„¢ PDF Toolbox API breaks the signature,
     * and therefore the cryptographic part needs to be removed. In general, the
     * visual appearance is regarded as worthless without the cryptographic
     * part, it is removed by default. The visual appearance can be preserved by
     * setting the flag {@code FLATTEN_SIGNATURE_APPEARANCES}.
